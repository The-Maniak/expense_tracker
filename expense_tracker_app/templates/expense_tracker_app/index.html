            <p>How many times have you asked yourself "where's my money?!" How many times have you experienced that
                uncomfortable situation, when you're at the cash counter, trying to make a payment and failing to do
                so?</p>
            <p>Well if it was even once, than you're correct thinking it was one time too many. But don't worry, it
                won't happen again. </p>
            <p>The Expense Tracker Application is a simple but efficient online platform, which is going to help you
                keep track of your spending. And more awareness of where does your money go will surely mean less
                surprises that it is not where you expected it to be - your account.</p>
            <p>So go ahead, create an account and start being in control from right now onwards!</p>
